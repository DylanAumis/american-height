Multiplayer card game with Vue.Js /Express.Js , it is clearly not finished though.
only the auth module works but still needs to be changed.


### Install depedencies first on both server and client sides (which means you need two shells)

```
npm install
```

### On the server shell you need to run

```
npm run start
```

### On the client shell you will need to run

```
npm run dev
```

### You can now connect to localhost:8080
